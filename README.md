# SADS
Social Anxiety Disorder Simulator

# What it's about
Picture this. You're a student, around age 13-14, and you've just moved to a new town, full of new, different and exciting opportunities. You have written a list of what needs to be done in a timetable, ranging from buying milk to partying with classmates. The only caveat to this, is that you are cursed with social anxiety. Anxiety so bad that just making eye contact with a stranger causes you to sweat. By legging it straight to the exit, playing stealthy and sticking to the shadows, or planning out a perfect strategy, you can make you way to your destination and back without having an anxiety attack.

SADS is a game about thinking, with numerous ways to complete each level, and hopefully a level editor in the future, there is near limitless fun to be had.

All the temporary images are not in certain folders. These will be deleted when the final versions of them are done and in the correct locations.
